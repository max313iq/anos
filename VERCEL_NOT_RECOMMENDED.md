# Vercel Deployment Not Recommended

## Issue
LiteLLM proxy is **not suitable for Vercel serverless functions** due to:

1. **Large dependency tree** - 65+ packages including heavy ML libraries
2. **Cold start times** - Serverless functions timeout during initialization
3. **Package size limits** - Exceeds Vercel's 50MB limit for serverless functions
4. **Database requirements** - Needs persistent PostgreSQL connection
5. **Stateful operations** - Proxy maintains state that doesn't work well with serverless

## Recommended Alternatives

### 1. **Railway** (Recommended)
- Persistent containers
- Built-in PostgreSQL
- Better for long-running services
- Deploy: `railway up`

### 2. **Render**
- Free tier available
- PostgreSQL included
- Good for Python apps

### 3. **Fly.io**
- Global edge deployment
- Persistent volumes
- Docker-based

### 4. **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- Simple deployment
- Managed databases
- Good pricing

## Why Vercel Fails

The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'typing_extensions'` occurs because:
- Vercel's Python runtime doesn't properly install all transitive dependencies
- The package is too large for serverless cold starts
- LiteLLM requires system-level dependencies not available in Vercel's sandbox

## Solution

**Use Railway or another container-based platform instead of Vercel.**

Railway deployment is already configured in this repo and works perfectly.
